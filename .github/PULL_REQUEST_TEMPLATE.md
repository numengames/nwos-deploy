## What

<!-- One paragraph: what this PR changes. -->

## Why

<!-- The mission, decision, or incident that motivates it. Reference
practice IDs from standards/STD-015-engineering-checks.md when applicable
(e.g. SEC-007, LIC-007). -->

## How to verify

<!-- Commands or URLs a reviewer can use, and the evidence it works: the
tests run and their result; before and after for anything visible. -->

## Definition of Done

- [ ] CI green (licence guard + build)
- [ ] The test commit precedes the code commit, and the test failed before the code existed (DEV-008)
- [ ] No content weakened a check to pass (§7.2.6)
- [ ] Every new file declares its own licence (SPDX comment in the file; `license:` too if it has a header; REUSE.toml only for files that cannot hold a comment)
- [ ] Mission execution log updated, if this PR executes a mission
- [ ] Nothing irreversible done without Oracle sign-off (§7.3)
