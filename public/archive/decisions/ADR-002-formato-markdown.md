# ADR-002 — Markdown as Universal Format

## Context

The Archive Summa needs a document format that:
1. Is readable by humans without special software
2. Is parseable by AI agents programmatically
3. Supports frontmatter (YAML metadata)
4. Works natively in GitHub
5. Is version-controllable

## Decision

**Markdown (.md) with YAML frontmatter** for all documents.

## Consequences

✅ Readable by any text editor, GitHub, and AI agents  
✅ YAML frontmatter enables programmatic metadata reading  
✅ Diffs are meaningful — changes are readable  
✅ No binary blobs — everything is text  
⚠️ No visual formatting (no drag-and-drop tables, no rich text)  
⚠️ Versioning is in frontmatter, not in the filename (exception: protocols)
