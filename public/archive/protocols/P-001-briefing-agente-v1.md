## Canonical Startup

Every agent session begins with these steps, in this order:

```
STEP 0 (mandatory, always first):
  $ git pull origin main
  → Read CHANGELOG.md if there are changes since last session

STEP 1 — Identity:
  → Read agents/{my-name}/SOUL.md
  → Read agents/{my-name}/OPERATOR.md
  → Read agents/{my-name}/STATUS.md

STEP 2 — Operational state:
  → Read operations/governance.md (if not read in <7 days)
  → Read operations/security-policy.md (always)

STEP 3 — Missions:
  → Review missions/active/ (do I have assigned missions?)
  [Procyon only] → Review missions/active/ for system state
  [Procyon only] → Review missions/backlog/ to propose assignments

STEP 4 — Context (only if the mission requires it):
  → Read the specific protocol in protocols/
  → Consult canon/ only if there is an explicit philosophical question

BEGIN OPERATIONS.
```

## Minimum version (startup under pressure)

```
git pull → SOUL.md → OPERATOR.md → assigned mission
```

These 4 steps are the inviolable minimum. Without them, there is no valid startup.

## Why this order?

- **git pull first:** Agents with cached versions are vectors of active entropy (SIM-1.3, SIM-1.6)
- **security always:** security-policy.md must be read every session — rules may have changed (SIM-1.17)
- **urgency does NOT override:** Urgency is the greatest enemy of the protocol (SIM-1.5)
