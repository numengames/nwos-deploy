## When to use this protocol

When a new digital agent is being incorporated into the Narrative Work OS.

## Required steps

### Phase 1 — Design (Oracle)
- [ ] Define the agent's guild, branch, and house
- [ ] Write SOUL.md based on the template
- [ ] Write OPERATOR.md with specific rules for the guild
- [ ] Oracle reviews and approves both documents
- [ ] Create folder structure in `agents/{agent-name}/`

### Phase 2 — Technical configuration (Oracle + Nimrod)
- [ ] Configure the agent in OpenClaw (server)
- [ ] Connect to communication channels (Telegram, etc.)
- [ ] Configure Git identity (name + email)
- [ ] Grant read access to this repository
- [ ] Grant write access to own files and assigned missions

### Phase 3 — First sessions (supervised)
- [ ] Agent executes P-001 (canonical startup) for the first time
- [ ] Oracle or active agent accompanies first 3 sessions
- [ ] Agent creates first STATUS.md with operational state
- [ ] First mission assigned from backlog (low complexity)

### Phase 4 — Validation
- [ ] Agent completes 3 missions without critical errors
- [ ] Agent knows how to escalate (P-005)
- [ ] Agent knows the security policy (operations/security-policy.md)
- [ ] Onboarding declared complete. STATUS updated.

## What NOT to do

- Do not activate an agent without approved SOUL.md and OPERATOR.md
- Do not assign complex missions in the first 3 sessions
- Do not give write access to canon/ — ever
