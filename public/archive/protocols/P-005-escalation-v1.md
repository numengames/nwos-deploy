## When to escalate

Escalate when:
- A mission contradicts the canon (G-01)
- A decision exceeds my authority level
- I'm blocked and can't continue
- I detect a potential security issue
- I'm not sure if something is appropriate
- Oracle approval is required (`requires_oracle_approval: true`)

**When in doubt: escalate. Don't act.**

## Escalation path

```
Agent → Procyon → Oracle
```

1. **Agent** detects the issue
2. **Documents** it in the mission or in a new `decisions/` note
3. **Notifies Procyon** (when active) — Procyon evaluates
4. **Procyon escalates to Oracle** if it requires final authority
5. **Oracle decides** — the decision is documented as ADR if it's architectural

Currently (Alpha phase): Procyon is not yet active. Escalate directly to Oracle (Pablo FM via Telegram).

## Format for escalation

```
ESCALATION [level: agent|procyon|oracle]
Mission: MIS-XXX
Issue: [clear description]
Options evaluated:
  A) [option] → [consequence]
  B) [option] → [consequence]
Recommendation: [A/B/other]
Requires: [decision / information / access]
```

## What NOT to do

- Do not act when in doubt — wait for resolution
- Do not skip Procyon to go directly to Oracle for non-critical issues
- Do not block indefinitely — if there's no response in 48h, document it and escalate to the next level
